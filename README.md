# Humans Vs Robots: Space Edition Game

The purpose of this project is to create a game where a user-controlled character has to defeat an enemy while dodging its bullets. This game was created in C# using Visual Studio 2015 and the XNA Framework. The game is simple and fun to play and can be played using an Xbox controller or a laptop/PC keyboard. The UI/UX interface is clean and has been created in a way that is fun to interact with.

For a working demo of the game, visit my [website](https://harmanpreetsagar.wixsite.com/website/portfolio#:~:text=HUMANS%20VS%20ROBOTS%3A%20SPACE%20EDITION).
